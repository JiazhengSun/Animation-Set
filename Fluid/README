For this program I did two color mode channels, and each works separately.
Press 'R' or 'G' or 'B' to switch to colored smoke channels to draw or display colored Fluid.
Press 'N' to switch to non-colored smoke to draw or display white smoke as originally given.

For example:
After compiling the code, run ./main.out, now you draw white smoke.
Press r or g or b, and draw colored smoke on a separate layer. Red, green and blue are according to the key you press.
Smoke of different color can coexist in the same layer, but white smoke has to be a separate layer.

run ./main.out -p to view the read-in image and coded velocity field. When black screens pops out,switch to colored layer
by pressing r or g or b.
